    "**Decription:**\n",
    "Script to solve a pipe-rotating puzzle for the Watch Cats problem in the CODE BLUE CTF 2018 Quals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, theres a water source in pipe segment 0, various joints of different shapes which connect certain segments and which can be rotated 90 degress at a time, and a set of goal segments. You must determine orientations for the different joints which allow the water be able to flow to all the goal segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Puzzles are in the following (dictionary) format:\n",
    "- attempts: the max number of rotations allowed\n",
    "- num_cables: the number of segments of pipe\n",
    "- num_joints: the number of rotate-able pipe joints\n",
    "- connections: list containing lists of the segments each joint connects to in order N,E,S,W (-1 if there is no segment in a direction)\n",
    "- joint_types: encodes the style and initial rotation of each joint ( e.g. 0 -> |_ )\n",
    "- goals: a list of segments that must be joined to the 0th segment to win\n",
    "\n",
    "The required output is:\n",
    "- The number of times each pipe joint should be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Plan:**\n",
    "The intial plan was to implement some kind of dynamic programming approach to the problem, noting that:\n",
    "- If S[i,j] is the set of rotation states of the joints which join pipe segments i and j\n",
    "- then S[i,j] = Union{ S[i,k] n S[k,j] for k != i,j }\n",
    "\n",
    "and then trying to find suitable constraints on k to avoid cyclic subproblem dependence. However I wasn't able to find such a constraint which made the subproblems non-cyclic and which would give a correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actual solution:**\n",
    "Instead, we calculate the set of rotation states that connect a given path from the 0th segment to a goal segment, storing the set of states connecting all subpaths from 0 to avoid recalculation:\n",
    "- S[*path*] = set of rotation states of the joints which make *path* connected\n",
    "- where *path* starts at 0\n",
    "\n",
    "For each goal, we find the union over all simple paths from 0 to the goal of the states which connect the path. Then take the intersection of these over all goals:\n",
    "- States[*goal*] = Union{ S[*path*] for each *path* a simple path from 0 to *goal* }\n",
    "- FinalStates = Intersection{ States[*goal*] for each *goal* in goals }\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional filtering step gives us those rotation states which can be achieved in less than or exactly *attempts* rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representations:**\n",
    "- Storing the set of rotation states explicitly takes up way too much memory, so instead they are stored as a union of hyperplanes in the *num_joints*-dimensional space, where hyperplanes are represented as a pair of lists: one giving the *free* dimensions (i.e. those joints which can be in any rotation state they like), and one giving the rotations of those joints that are *fixed* (and the rotations for those that are free just being given as 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional notes:**\n",
    "- The given Stage 5 is actually unsolvable: joint 32 redirects the flow from 0 into at most one of two distinct connected components, each of which contains goals.\n",
    "- The expectation of the CTF challenge was to actually break the verification program to get it to think that the stage had been solved. To this end I have also included an additional *debug* joint type which looks like a +.\n",
    "- My hope was to find a solution to the stage if joint 32 were replaced by a +, then overflow the integer storing the direction that joint 32 is facing to make it negative. The C++ modulus operator preserves the sign of the first argument, so then instead of checking the configuration for joint 32, the verifier program would potentially check the config of the joint before it."
